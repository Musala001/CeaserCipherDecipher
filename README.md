# Caesar Cipher - Java Implementation 🔐

This is a simple Java program that demonstrates encryption and decryption using the classic Caesar Cipher (Shift Cipher) technique. It works with uppercase alphabetic characters and preserves spaces and punctuation.

## 📌 Features

- Encrypt any text using Caesar Cipher.
- Decrypt messages using the same shift key.
- Handles both letters and special characters.
- Console-based interface using `Scanner`.

## 🧠 What is a Caesar Cipher?

A Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3:
